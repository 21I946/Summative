            <h1>My Growing Pain</h1>
            <p>1. During the process of coding, the newfound language often appeared difficult to understand, especially when different words performed similarly, such as position:sticky and position:fixed. Issues regarding the priority within codes’ style have also constantly inflicted damage onto my process, slowing the process down by a lot. However, after inquiring about the issue with the teacher, I was able to gain an insight upon the various niche languages used within coding, finally assisting me onto the correct path of learning coding in html. </p>

            <p>2. Oftentimes, codes of mine may not work and may be difficult for one to go through their code, change one aspect at a time, save and check in a web browser. Thankfully, Teacher Howard has taught us to inspect aspects within the code on the browser, change small stats one at a time as well as clicking on and off allows for a more efficient way to find the issue, then go back to coding software to change the part with issue specifically. </p>

            <p>3. Wireframing is much easier than coding as it offers direct action and reaction, providing constant feedback to the user and visually easier for starters to understand; on the other hand, coding is working in the backstage, save check whether or not the outcome is what was initially intended, requiring more understanding of what you are doing before actually viewing it. Due to these constant requirements of imagination before actually creating it, people creating coding may often think of it as the harder option among the 2 options. </p>

            <p>4. One thing I learnt about myself during the process of learning to code is the ability of finding faulty aspects. During the process of finding issues within a page, my ability and my way of finding the issue has proven to be efficient, allowing me to find and fix stuff in a matter of minutes. </p>
